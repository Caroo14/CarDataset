# CarDataset
Vehicle Data Analysis with Python This project explores trends in vehicle characteristics such as MSRP (price), engine horsepower, drivetrain type, and fuel efficiency using Python and visualizations in Google Colab. The dataset includes various vehicle makes, models, and technical specifications.
 Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to uncover relationships between:

MSRP and vehicle size

Engine horsepower and price

Drivetrain type and cost differences

Transmission type and fuel efficiency (MPG)

# Techniques Used
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, filtered inconsistent data entries, corrected data types.

Data Visualization: Created scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to identify trends and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed how key features relate to MSRP, fuel efficiency, and popularity.

# Key Insights
Larger vehicles tend to be more expensive, especially SUVs, trucks, and vans.

Higher engine horsepower = higher price — strong positive correlation.

Rear-Wheel Drive and All-Wheel Drive vehicles are pricier, with many luxury outliers.

Manual transmissions are the least fuel-efficient, while electric vehicles (direct drive) perform best.

Popular brands are not necessarily the most powerful or expensive — popularity is influenced by other factors.

Electric vehicles show promise, but more data is needed to draw strong conclusions.

# Tools & Libraries
pandas and numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Google Colab as the development environment
